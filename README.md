# PS3: The Ultimate eSports & Gaming Community Hub

## 1. Team Name - TechCraft
**Problem Statement:**
The gaming community lacks a dedicated, all-in-one platform where gamers can connect, compete, and grow. While live streaming, social networking, and event participation exist on separate platforms, there isn't a unified space that integrates all these features. Gamers struggle to find competitive events, build communities, and interact in real-time, while event organizers face challenges in reaching the right audience and managing registrations. Your task is to build a comprehensive platform to bridge this gap.
